```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This r markdown will show you how to grab indivdial samples from the data set.

Here I am loading the data set and loading packages

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load('data/Urine_Working.RData')
```

The sample IDs will all be stored in this variable

```{r, include=TRUE}
### Store all sampleID for future use
All_Urine_ID <- Urine.Working %>% pull(SampleID) %>% unique() %>% as.vector()
head(All_Urine_ID)
```

Here is how to grab a sample given the ID. Below I have the sample 1a. I am showing the heading of the data set and then the graph of the sample sample 1a

```{r}
working.sample <- Urine.Working %>% filter(SampleID == All_Urine_ID[1])
All_Urine_ID[1]

head(working.sample)
ggplot(working.sample, aes(x = Temperature, y = dCp)) + geom_line()
```
